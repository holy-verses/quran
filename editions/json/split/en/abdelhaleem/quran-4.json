Yet some people argue about God, without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating scripture","When they are told, ‘Follow what God has sent down,’ they say: ‘We shall follow what we saw our forefathers following.’ What! Even if Satan is calling them to the suffering of the Blazing Flame","Whoever directs himself wholly to God and does good work has grasped the surest handhold, for the outcome of everything is with God","As for those who refuse to do this, do not let their refusal sadden you [Prophet]- they will return to Us and We shall tell them what they have done: God knows all that hearts contain","We let them enjoy themselves for a little while, but We shall drive them to a harsh torment","If you ask them who created the heavens and earth, they are sure to say, ‘God.’ Say, ‘Praise belongs to God,’ but most of them do not understand","Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to God.

No, they are not equal","Those who believe and do good deeds will have Gardens awaiting them as their home and as a reward for what they have done","As for those who defy God, their home will be the Fire.

You will not be blamed if you make a mistake, only for what your hearts deliberately intend; God is most forgiving and merciful","The Prophet is more protective towards the believers than they are themselves, while his wives are their mothers.

When fear comes, you [Prophet] see them looking at you with eyes rolling like someone in their death throes; when fear has passed, they attack you with sharp tongues and begrudge you any good. Such men do not believe, and God brings their deeds to nothing- that is all too easy for God","They think the joint forces have not gone, and if the joint forces did come again they would wish they were in the desert, wandering among the Bedouin and seeking news about you [from a safe distance]. Even if they were with you [believers], they would hardly fight at all","The Messenger of God is an excellent model for those of you who put your hope in God and the Last Day and remember Him often","When the believers saw the joint forces, they said, ‘This is what God and His Messenger promised us: the promise of God and His Messenger is true,’ and this only served to increase their faith and submission to God","There are men among the believers who honoured their pledge to God: some of them have fulfilled it by death, and some are still waiting. They have not changed in the least","[Such trials are ordained] so that God may reward the truthful for their honesty and punish the hypocrites, if He so wills, or He may relent towards them, for God is forgiving and merciful","God sent back the disbelievers along with their rage- they gained no benefit–– and spared the believers from fighting.

If you are truly mindful of God, do not speak too softly in case the sick at heart should lust after you, but speak in an appropriate manner","stay at home, and do not flaunt your finery as they used to in the pagan past; keep up the prayer, give the prescribed alms, and obey God and His Messenger.

When Zayd no longer wanted her, We gave her to you in marriage so that there might be no fault in believers marrying the wives of their adopted sons after they no longer wanted them.

God knows what is in your hearts: God is all knowing, forbearing","You [Prophet] are not permitted to take any further wives, nor to exchange the wives you have for others, even if these attract you with their beauty. But this does not apply to your slave-girls: God is watchful over all","Believers, do not enter the Prophet’s apartments for a meal unless you are given permission to do so; do not linger until [a meal] is ready. When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God’s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God’s eyes","God has full knowledge of all things, whether you reveal them or not","The Prophet’s wives are not to blame [if they are seen by] their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their women, or their slaves.

The Hour may well be near","God has rejected the disbelievers and prepared a blazing fire for them","There they will stay permanently, with no one to befriend or support them","On the Day when their faces are being turned about in the Fire, they will say, ‘If only we had obeyed God and the Messenger,’","and ‘Lord! We obeyed our masters and our chiefs, and they led us astray","Lord!
